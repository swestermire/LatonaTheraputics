				<h1> 
					We are a Chicago-based team of scientists, engineers, and business professionals, all with a passion for 
					developing safer and more effective healthcare treatments. Through the Nano Startup Challenge in Cancer, hosted by The Center for Advancing Innovation (CAI) 
					and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), we developed a business plan for commercializing an NIH patent in nanotechnology. 
					We became one of 10 winners of the competition, and have since never looked back.
					We created Latona Therapeutics to develop this technology with the hope of saving lives.
